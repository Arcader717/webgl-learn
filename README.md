# webgl-learn

Suprisingly, I haven't learned how to use webgl. I used MDN, but that didn't work out too well, so I'm using [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) for this repo. Also, I'm using github pages, despite not knowing how to use it lmao

Sometimes, for some reason, it takes forever for github pages to update my page. Why bro
